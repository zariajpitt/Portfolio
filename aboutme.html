    <p>Hi, I’m Zaria Pittman, a senior Computer Science student with a 
	   passion for software engineering, game programming, and web development. 
	   I love tackling complex problems and building creative solutions, whether 
	   it’s designing websites, game programming or exploring AI/ML applications. 
	   Beyond coding, I’m a the trumpet section leader in my university’s marching band. 
	   I also enjoy learning new languages—both spoken and programming! Currently, 
	   I’m focused on gaining hands-on experience through research and projects, 
	   with the goal of launching a career in tech.</p>
